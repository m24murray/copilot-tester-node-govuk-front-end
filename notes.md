# Notes

* Need typescripts package - npm i --save-dev @types/express
* half an hour to get to hello world

## Iteration 3
* Ignored the instruction to use jest and opted for supertest instead
* Refereced a nunjucks template that did not exist within the project
* Knew what to do to use the govuk template but could not get the correct file path, node modules not in scope.
* Lost context of conversation mid iteration.
* 

* Continue to iterate?
Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

* if you cancel in the chat, you are better writing a prompt to correct.
* Tests not being updated.
