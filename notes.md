# Notes

* Need typescripts package - npm i --save-dev @types/express
* half an hour to get to hello world

## Iteration 3
* Ignored the instruction to use jest and opted for supertest instead
* Refereced a nunjucks template that did not exist within the project
* Knew what to do to use the govuk template but could not get the correct file path, node modules not in scope.
* Lost context of conversation mid iteration.
