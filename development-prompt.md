# Development prompt

You are an expert software engineer, tasked with implementing a new node.js web app.

The project specification can be found in `spec.md`, and I have a plan for implementing in `implementation-plan.md`.

Look at the implementation plan and work your way through each of the iterations sequentially. Development may have already begun, so review the `changelog.md` to refresh your context (create one if it doesn't exist).

You should start at the first iteration not marked as complete in the implementation plan.
